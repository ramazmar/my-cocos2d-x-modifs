# my-cocos2d-x-modifs

My cocosd2-x 2.2.3 modifications.

* CCMenuItem class modification, now it is possible to add a button with 2 selectors (one on press, another on drop)
* CCFollow class modification: New boolean variable with x axis movement. Used from CCBackground to decide if movement is needed.
